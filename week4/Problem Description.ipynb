This project is for those people who are looking for better neighborhoods. Person would love to shift a location which is exactly or almost similar to his/her last location because he/she loves the amenities and other types of venues that exist in his/her current neighbourhood like school, gym, swimming pool, Amusement park, restaurants, coffee-shops, culture etc.\n",

The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both freash and waste water and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.\n",
